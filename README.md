# PayPilot – Bill Payment Management Web Application

PayPilot is a full-stack bill payment management web application developed as a
team-based academic project. The application enables users to manage bills,
track payments, and view financial information through role-based dashboards.

My contributions focused primarily on backend development, database integration,
and application logic.

## 🚀 Features

- Role-based access control for Customer, Advisor, and Admin users
- Secure user authentication, registration, and password management
- Database-backed bill management with full CRUD functionality
- Advisor dashboards with aggregated and per-client financial views
- Admin workflows to create user accounts and assign or reassign advisors

## 🏗 Application Architecture

The application follows a classic three-layer architecture:

- **Presentation Layer:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript templates for user interaction
- **Application Layer:** Flask routes and business logic
- **Data Layer:** SQLite database for persistent storage

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub

## ⚙️ Setup (Local)

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
3. Run the Flask application locally
